## 🚀 Projects – Data Science Bootcamp

### 1. [Video Game Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/joshuaferreira327/video-game-sales-forecasting)
- **Objective:** Predict global game sales using historical sales, platform, genre, and review data.
- **Approach:** Cleaned data, engineered features (platform, genre, reviews), trained LightGBM models, validated using time-series methods.
- **Result:** Developed models that help forecast 2017 sales to inform marketing strategies.
- **Demo:** Thumbnail and summary available on LinkedIn and GitHub Featured.

### 2. [Gold Recovery Optimization](https://github.com/joshuaferreira327/gold-recovery-optimization)
- **Objective:** Optimize gold recovery rates using ore processing data.
- **Approach:** Preprocessed data, calculated recovery accuracy, screened anomalies, and trained regression models optimizing sMAPE.
- **Result:** Achieved improved model accuracy; insights provided for process optimization.

### 3. [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/joshuaferreira327/customer-churn-prediction)
- **Objective:** Predict telecom client churn based on service usage and contract info.
- **Approach:** Feature-engineered contract and service data, compared Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, used cross-validation and AUC-ROC evaluation.
- **Result:** Built model with **AUC-ROC ≈ 0.844**, enabling proactive churn strategies.
